## Damage from cyber-attacks to reach 6 trillion dollars by 2021
Cybersecurity is the action of securing networks, systems, and any other digital infrastructure from malicious attacks.
Experts expect the damage from cyber-attacks to reach 6 trillion dollars by 2021, itâ€™s no wonder companies, banks, tech companies, hospitals, government agencies and just about every other sector are investing in cybersecurity infrastructure to protect their business practices and the millions of customers that trust them with their data.

Businesses of all sizes need to ensure the safety and privacy of their companies and employees. Unfortunately, cybersecurity has always been a rather difficult topic to understand for those who are not responsible for it on a day-to-day basis.

There are dozens of ways to help prevent a cybersecurity attack on your business. While there is no single plan that works for all businesses, you should consider what needs to be secured and what could happen to your business if said item was stolen, modified, or destroyed.

The first way to protect your business is to understand your risks. Learn about the different kinds of threats to your business and how to prepare against them. Once you understand your risks, you should create an in-depth security policy outlining these.

## Types of Cyber Attacks: Passive vs. Active
There are many types of cyber-attacks that are possible for your business, but most will fall into one of two categories: passive or active.
### Passive
A passive attack is when an intruder observes, but does not modify, any messages in any way. While these attacks may not be harmful by themselves, the data collected can be exponential and damaging. These attacks are oftentimes difficult to detect as they are not actively trying to break into any systems. Some examples are:
Traffic Analysis: Learning about the network from observing traffic patterns - who is visiting what website, which files are being downloaded, et cetera.
Eavesdropping: Also known as "tapping", eavesdropping is when the intruder monitors unencrypted communications such as phone calls or emails.
Scanning: Performing a scan of a device connected to the internet to identify vulnerabilities such as a weak Operating System or open ports.

### Active
Active attacks are just that: actively seeking to modify or obtain information. This often results in changes to your data, systems, or even your infrastructure. Some common examples:
1. Denial-of-Service Attacks: Disrupting your services by overloading them and rendering them unavailable for its intended users.
2. Spoofing: The actual sender of an email is not who they claim to be.
3. Message Modification: Message is modified in some way in the transmission.
4. Viruses/Malware: The most well-known on this list, viruses and malware are typically designed to intrude and either damage or obtain critical information.

## Do You Need a Vulnerability Assessment?
A vulnerability assessment, also known as vulnerability analysis, is a process used to locate and identify any security-level defects (vulnerabilities) in a network or infrastructure. Vulnerability assessments help businesses pinpoint any vulnerabilities (such as coding bugs, security holes, etc.) before they have the chance to be compromised.
